# Toontown Rewritten Concept Launcher

**Toontown Rewritten Concept Launcher Launcher** is a rebuilt copy of the Toontown Rewritten Source Code found inside of the [TTR Flatpak](https://www.xytime.xyz/flatpaks/ttr/index.html). This project was originally created by [UnicorNora](https://github.com/UnicorNora/). Not trying to do anything malicious here the entire launcher is owned by Toontown Rewritten Team just found it interesting they didnt compile it for the flatpak.

## üìù Original Concept Design
The original concept design for this launcher was drawn by @PurpleYoshi774 on Twitter, so a big thank you to you for the idea.
